# Hello, I'm Alex Wolfe ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school computer science and technology teacher at Bio-Med Science Academy STEM School. I am also finishing a M.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Security in May 2021.

I'm excited about teaching students how to write code and program in Python as well as C++ for the Arduino.
