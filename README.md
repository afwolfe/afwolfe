# Hello, I'm Alex Wolfe ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school computer science and technology teacher at Bio-Med Science Academy STEM School. I am also graduating with a M.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Computer Security in May 2021.

I'm excited about expanding opportunities for CS education by teaching students how express themselves and solve problems using programming and computer science.
